      <p class="p">
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
        SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        <br /><br />Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to
        moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
        treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical
        attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions
        like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or
        cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick
        with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.

        <br /><br />The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be
        well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect
        yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart
        from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or
        using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your
        turn and follow local guidance.

        <br /><br />The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose
        in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or
        breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
        smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for
        example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and
        self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
